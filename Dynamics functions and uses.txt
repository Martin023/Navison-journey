TESTFIELD(fieldVal);
Breaks code in case the field value is not found.

CurrPage - Current page::Used to get the current page as a variable.

CurrPage.EDITABLE := FALSE;  -> Enabling or disabling editiong on a page

USING PERMISSIONS:
- Check if user has a particular permission by using setrange(); if the person does, then enable or disable access/editing etc.

GET(pk of subtype); -> Gets the record of a table using its primary key 
- You dont have to use reset first as in the case of SETRANGE();

rec.TESTFIELD(field,[value]); -> Compares field to value, If they dont match an error is displayed. 
Hoewever, if value is ommited, Then it checks for a value in the field, If absent an error msg is displayed.

rec/table.COUNT; -> Returns the number of records in the specific table after application of filters.

WITH Statement -> Conditional statement that is used to define the scope of a code block. It is used to create a local scope within a function or trigger 
---------------SYNTAX OF WITH:-----------

WITH Variable1 [AS Type]
   [Local Declarations]
BEGIN
   [Statements]
END;
-------------------------------------------

record.get();/record.GET; -> Used to retrieve information from a table. Without paramenters, ut fetches all records in the  table.
With parameters, it gets fields where the parameter in a PKey. You do not have to use record.RESET; function earlier before using the get function.

FORMAT(); -> Used to format a string into a specific format such as adding trailing zeros or formating a data. It 
takes a string as an argument and modifies it according to a specified format. 
example : With numbers, it rounds it 
eg  FORMAT(123.456, 2); // 123.47 
With no params, it rounds to 0dp.
With string it : 



DATE2DMY(date,1,2or3); -> converts a date data type value to a string with DD/MM/YYYY format.
1 -returns day as an integer
2- returns no as integer
3- year as integer


It takes a valid date or datetime expression as its parameter and returns a string.
It may take 3 params Date to be converted, the delimiter->Separator eg-,/or . And a boolean parameter for whether to include day of week.(1,0 or true and false)

TIME(); Is a function that is used to return the time of day using 24hr clock system. It returns a datetime value.
Example use : x:=TIME;
The result will be the current date and time, in the format of yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss. For example: 2020-10-09 12:15:00.


DELCHR() -> Deletes one or more characters in a string. [It is case sensitive]
-NewString := DELCHR(String[, Where][, Which])
String : String to be altered
Where : Specifies where to delete characters, can be a text constant or code.
The Which parameter contains an array of the characters that you want to delete. 
The order of the characters is of no significance. If String contains a character that is specified in Which, it is deleted from String.
You can include one or more of the following characters in the Where string:

= To delete any character in String that matches a character in Which (default)

< To delete any leading character in String that matches a character in Which

> To delete any trailing character in String that matches a character in Which


Which : Specifies the characters that you want to delete.
Type: Text or code
The default is a space character.

ReqFilterFields -> This is a report property put on a dataitem. It sets fields to be automatically added in the tab of the request page from the dataitem.
The user can set filters on these fields.

NB - You can remove the request page by using the UseRequestPage property and set it to NO.

record.SETCURRENTKEY(FIeld,[field1,...FieldN] -> set current key sets the primary key of the table that you are working with, 
which tells the database engine how to locate and access the records in the table. This optimizes how records are filtered/ searched through the table.
The fields are the ones to be made primary keys.Setting the primary key helps the database engine to optimize certain operations, such as searching for a specific record,
 sorting the records in a specific order, or filtering records based on a specific field.

record.LOCKABLE([Wait:boolean],[versionCheck:boolean]); -> locks a table to prevent write transactions that conflict each other.
wait -> Specifies what to do if the table is already locked.
Because all write operations automatically lock the table that is being used, LOCKTABLE appears unnecessary.

DELCHR(String[, Where][, Which]) -> Deketes one or more chnaracters in a string. 
You can include one or more of the following characters in the Where string:

	= To delete any character in String that matches a character in Which (default)

	< To delete any leading character in String that matches a character in Which

	> To delete any trailing character in String that matches a character in Which

Which :
Type: Text or code

Specifies the characters that you want to delete.

The default is a space character.
STRPOS(String, Substring) -> finds the first occurence of a substring in a string.
it returns an integer, and takes CODE or String data types as params.
The STRPOS function is case-sensitive.


## The diffrence between Rec and xRec is that xRec holds the prev value of the current record. If modified then Rec <> xRec, otherwise, they are =

record.IsEmpty() -> (Works same as findfirst) Checks if there are records present after a filter / range is applied on a table.

currpage.UPDATE() -> Saves the current record and then updates the controls in the page. 
If you set the SaveRecord parameter to false, this function will not save the record before the page is updated.
