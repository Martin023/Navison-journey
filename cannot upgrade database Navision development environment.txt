delete the table data from SQL with

TRUNCATE TABLE [dbo].[NAV App Tenant App]

After this,we upgraded the database from Developer environment, Started the NAV service, and ran a Schema Sync.

After this, we had new records automatiaclly created in the [NAV App Tenant App] table, and everything seems to be working fine


Would be nice to have an official solution from microsoft. So far this is not documented in the installation process:
