Solving the "error 8192 incorrect language choosen" when opening microsoft Navision development environment.

This error has nothing to do with Navision but rather the language settings on your own machine or computer.
To solve this error, open the control center on windows computer > region and languages > language select English(US) and save the settings.
Next restart your Navison development for the change to apply or take effect.
Voila you should now be able to open the environment and develop away!

Hope this short explanation works for you.
